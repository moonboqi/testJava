* On a N * N grid, we place some 1 * 1 * 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.

Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of grid cell (i, j).

Now we view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.

A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3 dimensional figure to a 2 dimensional plane. 

Here, we are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.

Return the total area of all three projections.

 

Example 1:

Input: [[2]]
Output: 5
